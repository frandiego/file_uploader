# Automatic Photo Sorter & Uploader to PCloud
## Overview
This project automates the process of sorting photos taken with a camera by year and month, and then uploads them to 
PCloud. The program scans a directory for new images, organizes them into folders based on the date they were taken, 
and securely uploads them to the PCloud cloud storage service.
## Features
- **Automatic Sorting**: Organizes photos into subfolders by year and month based on the imageâ€™s metadata (creation 
date).
- **PCloud Integration**: Automatically uploads sorted photos to your PCloud account.
- **Efficient & Fast**: Designed to handle large batches of photos.
